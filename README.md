# Ray Tracing in One Weekend

A Raytracer based on the book, [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), written in Rust.

Currently, the rust code is as similar to the C++ version from the book as I could manage.
The [main.rs](/src/main.rs) file contains code used to render the final scene, as on the book cover.
